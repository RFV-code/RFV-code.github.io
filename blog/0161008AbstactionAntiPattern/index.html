<h1 id="abstraction-the-anti-pattern-of-computation">Abstraction, the Anti-Pattern of Computation</h1>
<p>Today, after much thought again, I realized that abstraction is in fact the <em>anti-pattern of computation</em>. In computer programming there are tones of ideas, frameworks, platforms, APIs, languages, tools, methodologies, etc, etc and yet at the very heart of it all lies computation and more specifically the computer. A computer is a <strong>real</strong> engineered physical machine that performs exactly as it was designed to do, so surely the field of computer engineering should be more, well, structured and organized?</p>
<p>The issue lies with abstraction. Abstraction is a good tool, but if you don't understand how to use that tool then you won't know what your tool is doing and what your actually busy with. The more abstract you become the less you think about whats actually happening.</p>
<p>Abstraction should only be used when you know how that abstraction relates the world without that abstraction, in other words you need to know what yous abstraction is doing.</p>
<p>Computation in itself is something which is very much a <strong>real</strong> thing as it always requires a <strong>real machine</strong> and a program runs in <strong>real <em>time</em></strong>..</p>
<p>Abstraction is like a great magic trick. If one wishes to fully engage or understand the trick, one needs to know how it is performed, and if you don't really want to spoil the <em>magic</em>, then at the very least: you have to remember that it's just a magic trick.
It's <em>not</em> <strong>real</strong>.</p>
<p>Real world targets, deadlines, and then neutrally people who have flaws, egos, tastes, etc, etc is the <strong>real</strong> reason that the world of software is in the state that it is today. Although I'm not expecting it to happen, I do think that future generations will benefit if everyone takes a little bit of time to find out what everyone else is busy d. But since the world of software development is not driven by making things work better (better under the hood, and more efficient), just as the rest of the world is not driven by making things more efficient and more sustainable (engineering, energy, logistics), but by many factors such as profits, politics, etc. Just so the world of software development will linger on in a state of mess. The thing is though, that software in itself (not the running of software, but the data representation of software) is such a pure and concrete thing, that I believe it time for Universities to really take a pause and re-evaluate what we are busy with. CPU's are not simply going to keep getting better.</p>
<p>The common denominator of the computer of today (PC, Server, Mobile, Raspberry Pi) is the Von Neumann Architecture which in turn uses the concept of the Turing machine.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-world-of-program-abstractions">The current world of program abstractions.</h2>
<p>To understand your abstractions (in the imperative programming world) you need to understand the evolution of software engineering abstraction, and in parallel the evolution of programming languages in order of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turing Machine (3 basic statements: conditional statement [if-then], jump [move execution to another position], change [do a combinatory logic execution])</li>
<li>Variables and data structures (such as int, string, or any block of sequential data)</li>
<li>The procedure (which requires a stack)</li>
<li>Removal of the Goto statement (since procedures can structure code into blocks of tree structures) *LANGUAGE FEATURE REDUCING COMPUTATION ABILITY - no longer Turing complete</li>
<li>Run-time: dynamic memory management and allocation, pointers (run time allocated memory address)</li>
<li>Objects: grouping procedures and variables together and enabling easy dynamic allocation of new such objects. Procedures have limited access to its own variables and are called methods. *LANGUAGE FEATURE REDUCING COMPUTATION ABILITY (syntactic sugar: makes life easy for doing common things, when used)</li>
<li>Exceptions, Garbage Collection, Dynamic Typing, Run-time compilation, etc, etc *LANGUAGE FEATURE REDUCING COMPUTATION ABILITY (syntactic sugar: makes life easy for doing common things, when used) These  are all good default features for a language to have but since they are not optional (not extensions, but replacements), and mandatory they actually reduce the overall possible computation possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that we are capable of much more amazing computational application then we even realize. The software world seems to move in this monolithic way where we tend to crate thing that we already know, leading to the same old same old. I am not an expert in any language, and that doesn't matter for me to be able to write this article. Perhaps it is because I am not an expert and tied down to any specific way of thinking that I am able to state here, what I think many programmer already intuitively know by themselves.</p>
