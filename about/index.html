<p>I'm a financial person and a computer person. I love to think outside of the box and to understand the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Currently I am enjoying the low cost of living in PHilipines as I am advacing my programming skills: focussing on functional programming at the moment. Bellow is my mind dump:</p>

    Abstraction
        The process of picking out (abstracting) common features of objects and procedures. A programmer would 
        use abstraction, for example, to note that two functions perform almost the same task and can be combined 
        into a single function. Abstraction is one of the most important techniques in software engineering and is
        closely related to two other important techniques - encapsulation and information hiding. All three
        techniques are used to reduce complexity.
    Algorithm
        A formula or set of steps for solving a particular problem. To be an algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and have a clear stopping point. Algorithms can be expressed in any language, from natural languages like English or French to programming languages.
        We use algorithms every day. For example, a recipe for baking a cake is an algorithm. Most programs, with the exception of some artificial intelligence applications, consist of algorithms.
    Bug
        An error or defect in software or hardware that causes a program to malfunction. According to folklore, the first computer bug was an actual bug. Discovered by Lieutenant Grace Hopper in 1945 at Harvard, a moth trapped between two electrical relays of the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator caused the whole machine to shut down.
    Constant
        In programming, a constant is a value that never changes.
    Dynamic Variable
        In programming, a dynamic variable is a variable whose address is determined when the program is run. In contrast, a static variable has memory reserved for it at compilation time.
    Encapsulation
        In programming, the process of combining elements to create a new entity. For example, a procedure is a type of encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions. Likewise, a complex data type, such as a record or class, relies on encapsulation. Object-oriented programming languages rely heavily on encapsulation to create high-level objects. Encapsulation is closely related to abstraction and information hiding.
    Exception
        A condition, often an error, that causes the program or microprocessor to branch to a different routine. The terms interrupt and exception are very close in meaning. Both can be used to refer to either hardware or software. The only real difference is that an exception usually indicates an error condition.
    Flow Control
        In communications
            the process of adjusting the flow of data from one device to another to ensure that the receiving device can handle all of the incoming data. This is particularly important where the sending device is capable of sending data much faster than the receiving device can receive it.
        In programming
            the statements and other constructs that control the order in which operations are executed. For example, common looping statements such as for…next and while are known as flow control statements. Branching statements, such as if…then are also part of a programming language's flow control mechanism.
    Garbage In, Garbage Out
        if invalid data is entered into a system, the resulting output will also be invalid. Although originally applied to computer software, the axiom holds true for all systems, including, for example, decision-making systems.
    Heuristic Programming
        A branch of artificial intelligence, which uses heuristics - common-sense rules drawn from experience - to solve problems. This is in contrast to algorithmic programming, which is based on mathematically provable procedures. Heuristic programming is characterized by programs that are self-learning; they get better with experience. Heuristic programs do not always reach the very best result but usually produce a good result. Many expert systems use heuristic programming.
    Information Hiding
        The process of hiding details of an object or function. Information hiding is a powerful programming technique because it reduces complexity. One of the chief mechanisms for hiding information is encapsulation - combining elements to create a larger entity. The programmer can then focus on the new object without worrying about the hidden details. In a sense, the entire hierarchy of programming languages - from machine languages to high-level languages - can be seen as a form of information hiding.
        also used to prevent programmers from changing - intentionally or unintentionally - parts of a program.
    Iteration
        A single pass through a group of instructions. Most programs contain loops of instructions that are executed over and over again. The computer iterates through the loop, which means that it repeatedly executes the loop.
    Loop
        In programming, a loop is a series of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is met. Each pass through the loop is called an iteration. Loops constitute one of the most basic and powerful programming concepts.
    Memory Leak
        A bug in a program that prevents it from freeing up memory that it no longer needs. As a result, the program grabs more and more memory until it finally crashes because there is no more memory left.
    Mutex
        Short for mutual exclusion object. In computer programming, a mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously. When a program is started, a mutex is created with a unique name. After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. The mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.
    Parse
        In linguistics, to divide language into small components that can be analyzed. 
        Parsing is often divided into lexical analysis and semantic parsing. Lexical analysis concentrates on dividing strings into components, called tokens, based on punctuation and other keys. Semantic parsing then attempts to determine the meaning of the string.
    Refactoring
        Improving the design of existing software code. Refactoring doesn't change the observable behavior of the software; it improves its internal structure. For example, if a programmer wants to add new functionality to a program, he may decide to refactor the program first to simplify the addition of new functionality in order to prevent software entropy.
    Regression Testing
        The selective retesting of a software system that has been modified to ensure that any bugs have been fixed and that no other previously-working functions have failed as a result of the reparations and that newly added features have not created problems with previous versions of the software. Also referred to as verification testing, regression testing is initiated after a programmer has attempted to fix a recognized problem or has added source code to a program that may have inadvertently introduced errors. It is a quality control measure to ensure that the newly-modified code still complies with its specified requirements and that unmodified code has not been affected by the maintenance activity.
    Runtime
        Occurring while a program is executing. For example, a runtime error is an error that occurs during program execution and a runtime library is a library of routines that are bound to the program during execution. In contrast, compile-time refers to events that occur while a program is being compiled.
    Scalable
        how well a hardware or software system can adapt to increased demands. For example, a scalable network system would be one that can start with just a few nodes but can easily expand to thousands of nodes. Scalability can be a very important feature because it means that you can invest in a system with confidence you won't outgrow it.
    Semaphore
        A hardware or software flag. In multitasking systems, a semaphore is a variable with a value that indicates the status of a common resource. Its used to lock the resource that is being used. A process needing the resource checks the semaphore to determine the resource's status and then decides how to proceed.
    Software Entropy
        The tendency for software, over time, to become difficult and costly to maintain. A software system that undergoes continuous change, such as having new functionality added to its original design, will eventually become more complex and can become disorganized as it grows, losing its original design structure.
    Stateless
        Having no information about what occurred previously. Most modern applications maintain state, which means that they remember what you were doing last time you ran the application, and they remember all your configuration settings. This is extremely useful because it means you can mold the application to your working habits.
    Virtual Machine
        A self-contained operating environment that behaves as if it is a separate computer. For example, Java applets run in a Java virtual machine (VM) that has no access to the host operating system.
    White Box Testing
        Also known as glass box, structural, clear box and open box testing. A software testing technique whereby explicit knowledge of the internal workings of the item being tested are used to select the test data. Unlike black box testing, white box testing uses specific knowledge of programming code to examine outputs. The test is accurate only if the tester knows what the program is supposed to do. He or she can then see if the program diverges from its intended goal. White box testing does not account for errors caused by omission, and all visible code must also be readable.
