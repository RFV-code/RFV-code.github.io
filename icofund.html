						<b_g>Blockchain Investment Fund Objectives</b_g><br>
						<rn_d>
							<p>
							The recent wave of blockchain crowd-funding initiatives have quickly set the stage for the best investment opportunities in the last few years.<br>
							Some IPOs and ICOs have raised tremendous amounts of money from investors who are not well educated in the art of investing.</p>
							<p>
							It is for this reason that I set up a team of professional investors from my network and have created the blockchain <rb_g>ICOFund</rb_g>. I am a UK qualified professional investor with over 13 years of international experience in the investment world. Here, I have created a simple solution to diversify in the Bitcoin and Ethereum startup space. The objective of this fund is not so much to support the ideologies and dreams of these startup organizations but to capitalize on what the market says are good investment opportunities. The objective is to maximize returns in two ways: buying tokens whose market value will increase, and selling them before the market turns; and to hold onto tokens which provide some sort of profit share or dividend.</p>
							<p>
							The keys to low risk investing are <rb_g>research and experience</rb_g>. Due diligence, proper analysis of what's actually on offer, terms and conditions, and the actual legal structure of these initiative. These are but a few very important things to consider, and it seems like very few in the cryptocurrency community are taking these factors into consideration. Instead it seem that folks are willing to take bets on these because they view them as sound investments and because of past performance alone.</p>

							<b_g>Principles</b_g>
							<p>
							<rb_g>Don't be greedy:</rb_g> Take profit before the market turns.<br>
							<rb_g>Early Bird catches the worm:</rb_g> Do proper research and due diligence then buy when it's fresh and cheap.<br>
							<rb_g>Don't put all your eggs in one basket:</rb_g> Diversify by spiting the fund into several ICO offerings.<br>
							<rb_g>Practice what you preach:</rb_g> Any profit that the fund accumulates is kept in the fund as shares. In other words we invest all of profits in the same funds and stocks that we give you.<br>
							<rb_g>Don't judge a book by its cover:</rb_g> Spend as little effort as possible on cosmetics and focus on the substance, which is to make as much profit as possible.</p>
