						<b_d>Blockchain Investment Fund Objectives</b_d><br>
						<rn_d>
							<p>
							The recent wave of blockchain crowd-funding initiatives have quickly set the stage for the best investment opportunities in the last few years.	Some IPOs and ICOs have raised tremendous amounts of money from investors who are not well educated in the art of investing though.</p>
							<p>
							It is for this reason that we set up a team of professional investors and have created the ETH denominated blockchain <rb_g>ICO</rb_g><rb>Fund</rb>. The <rb_g>ICO</rb_g><rb>Fund</rb> is not a crowdsourcing initiative or a token sales, the <rb_g>ICO</rb_g><rb>Fund</rb> is a regulated investment vehicle into these initiatives. Here is an easy solution to a diversified investment in the Bitcoin and Ethereum startup space. The objective of this fund is not to support the ideologies and dreams of these startup organizations but to capitalize on what the market says are good investment opportunities. The objective is to maximize returns in two ways: buying tokens whose market value will increase, and selling them before the market turns; and to hold onto tokens which provide some sort of profit share or dividend.</p>
							<p>
							The keys to low risk investing are <rb_g>research and experience</rb_g>. Due diligence, proper analysis of what's actually on offer, terms and conditions, and the actual legal structures of these initiatives. These are but a few very important things to consider, and it seems like very few in the cryptocurrency community are taking these factors into consideration. Instead it seems like folks are willing to take risky bets on these because they view them as sound investments, simply because of past performance alone.</p>

							<b_d>Principles</b_d>
							<p>
							<rb_g>Don't judge a book by its cover:</rb_g> Spend as little resources as possible on looks and marketing and focus on the substance, which is to make as much profit as possible.<br>
							<rb_g>Don't be greedy:</rb_g> Take profit before the market turns.<br>
							<rb_g>Early bird catches the worm:</rb_g> Do proper research and due diligence, then buy when it's fresh and cheap.<br>
							<rb_g>Don't put all your eggs in one basket:</rb_g> Diversify by spliting the fund into several ICO offerings.<br>
							<rb_g>Practice what you preach:</rb_g> Any profit that the fund accumulates is kept in the fund as shares. In other words we invest all of profits in the same funds and stocks that we give you.<br></p>

							<b_d>Disclaimer</b_d>
							<p>
							All investments carry an element of risk and by investing in the <rb_g>ICO</rb_g><rb>Fund</rb> you accept these risks. We will not be held responsible for any loss due to market movements or for any other reason out of our control. Buying or selling units may take up to 24 hours to process. Some newer tokens may not have a sufficient market yet and we'll only sell them when we can at market value. The profit accumulation is valid for a 12 month period after which <rb_g>ICO</rb_g><rb>Fund</rb> may sell profit units to pay for ongoing research and expenses associated with running the fund. We publish daily values of the fund and the holdings data at the end of each calendar month (so that others can't copy our investment formula).</p>
